<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>How does this site organize the flow of information? (Do they have links
			on the left and text on the right? Some other scheme? No scheme?)</strong></dt><br>
		<dd>The flow of information on the main page of makes sense. The links to other areas of
		the websites are in line at the tope and groups of information are lined up below.  </dd><br>
	</dl>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>Does the site structure make sense or does it confuse you? Why? </strong></dt><br>

<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>Does the site graphics/layout/multimedia enhance the site or detract from it? Why? </strong></dt><br>
		<dd>The site's multimedia detracts from the site. The images are blurry, and poorly cropped. The embedded
		videos are everywhere; along the side bar, across the header, and they are very small.  </dd><br>

<br>
<li>
	<dl>

	</dl>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>Was the text color and size readable? If a background color or image was used,
		did it enhance or detract from the site? </strong></dt><br>
		<dd>The text is very small and hard to read. The colors are contrasting so that wasn’t
		really an issue.  </dd><br>
	</dl>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>Did the site have a navigation bar or other navigation tool?
		Was the navigation well done? </strong></dt><br>

		the site quite well. </dd><br>
	</dl>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>Did the site have a color scheme or look and feel that was repeated on all the pages? </strong></dt><br>
		<dd>The color schemes across the various pages were all over the place.
		Nearly each page has a different color scheme.  </dd><br>
	</dl>
</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>How does the site respond to smaller window sizes (responsive design)? </strong></dt><br>

</li>
<br>
<li>
	<dl>

		<dd>The site’s embedded videos and the vast amount of links was really unusual.  </dd><br>
